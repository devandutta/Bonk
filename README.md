Objective-C++ Kobold2D iOS math game

I built this iOS math game over the course of 3 months between my junior and senior year of high school.  Its purpose is to help elementary school students improve their math skills by quizzing them on addition and subtraction questions, while tracking progress, increasing difficulty, and rewarding players with custom animations that I programmed myself.

It was one of the most interesting projects I have ever done because it involved so much more than just coding.

I learned the core principles of a new language (Objective-C), an IDE (Xcode), and a platform (Kobold2D) in 10 days to immediately begin development.  I also learned about critical elements of software development, design principles for iOS games, and how to test my game for my audience.

Due to the use of a Physics engine, my code is written in Objective-C++.  I have also included resource files.
